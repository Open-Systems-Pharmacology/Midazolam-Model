Midazolam is a widely-used sedative, approved as premedication before surgical interventions. It is almost exclusively metabolized by CYP3A4, turning it into a sensitive probe and victim drug for the investigation of in vivo CYP3A4 activity. Midazolam shows substantial first pass metabolism, resulting in a bioavailability of under 50%. Less than 1% of a midazolam dose is excreted unchanged in urine.

The herein presented model represents an update of the midazolam model publisdhed by Hanke et al. ([Hanke 2018](#5-References)). The model has been  developed using in particular published pharmacokinetic clinical data by Hohmann et al. ([Hohmann 2015](#5-Reference)), Hyland et al. 2009 ([Hyland 2009](#5-References)) and Thummel et al. 1996 ([Thummel 1996](#5-References)). It has then been evaluated by comparing observed data to simulations of a large number of clinical studies covering a dose range from 0.05 mg/kg to 20 mg after intravenous and oral administrations. Furthermore, it has been evaluated within a CYP3A4 DDI modeling network as a victim drug. 

Model features include:

- CYP3A4 metabolism
- (direct) UGT1A4 metabolism
- excretion into urine via glomerular filtration
- a decrease in the permeability between the intracellular and interstitial space  (parameters "P (intracellular->interstitial)" and "P (interstitial->intracellular)") in intestinal mucosa to optimize quantitatively the extent of gut wall metabolism
- and binding to a hypothetical binding partner in the brain to optimize a late redistribution phase in midazolam plasma concentrations.
