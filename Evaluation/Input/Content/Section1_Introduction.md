Midazolam is a widely-used sedative, approved as premedication before surgical interventions. It is almost exclusively metabolized by CYP3A4 making it a sensitive probe and victim drug for the investigation of CYP3A4 activity *in vivo*. Midazolam shows substantial first pass metabolism resulting in a bioavailability of under 50%. Less than 1% of a midazolam dose is excreted unchanged in urine.

The herein presented model represents an update of the midazolam model published by Hanke et al. ([Hanke 2018](#5-references)). The model has been  developed using in particular published pharmacokinetic clinical data by Hohmann et al. ([Hohmann 2015](#5-references)), Hyland et al. 2009 ([Hyland 2009](#5-references)) and Thummel et al. 1996 ([Thummel 1996](#5-references)). It has then been evaluated by comparing observed data to simulations of a large number of clinical studies covering a dose range of 0.05 mg/kg to 20 mg after intravenous and oral administrations. Furthermore, it has been evaluated within a CYP3A4 DDI modeling network as a victim drug. 

Model features include:

- metabolism by CYP3A4
- (direct) metabolism by UGT1A4
- excretion into urine via glomerular filtration
- a decrease in the permeability between the intracellular and interstitial space (model parameters `P (intracellular->interstitial)` and `P (interstitial->intracellular)`) in intestinal mucosa to optimize quantitatively the extent of gut wall metabolism
- and binding to a hypothetical binding partner in the brain to optimize a late redistribution phase in midazolam plasma concentrations.
