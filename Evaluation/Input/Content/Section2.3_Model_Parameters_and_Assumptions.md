### 2.3.1 Absorption

The model parameter `Specific intestinal permeability` was optimized to best match clinical data (see  [Section 2.3.4](#2.3.4-Automated-Parameter-Identification)). The default solubility was assumed to be the measured value in the FaSSIF medium (see [Section 2.2.1](#2.2.1-In-vitro-and-physico-chemical-data))

The dissolution of tablets were implemented via an empirical Weibull dissolution tablet. However, dissolution does not seem to relevant in terms of *rate-limiting*; see results of optimization in [Section 2.3.4](#2.3.4-Automated-Parameter-Identification).

### 2.3.2 Distribution

Midazolam is moderately to highly protein bound (approx. 97 %) in plasma (see [Section 2.2.1](#2.2.1-In-vitro-and-physico-chemical-data)). A value of 3.1% was used in this PBPK model for `Fraction unbound (plasma, reference value)`. It was assumed that the major binding partner is albumin.

An important parameter influencing the resulting volume of distribution is lipophilicty. The reported experimental logP values are in the range of 3 (see [Section 2.2.1](#2.2.1-In-vitro-and-physico-chemical-data)) which served as a starting value. Finally, the model parameters `Lipophilicity` was optimized to match best clinical data (see also [Section 2.3.4](#2.3.4-Automated-Parameter-Identification)).

After testing the available organ-plasma partition coefficient and cell permeability calculation methods built in PK-Sim, observed clinical data was best described by choosing the partition coefficient calculation by `Rodgers and Rowland` and cellular permeability calculation by `PK-Sim Standard`.

Initial model building showed that the late disposition (approx. 24 hours after adminsitration) could not be well described. This effect was assumed to be (re-)distribution-related. Finally, binding to a hypothetical binding partner in the brain was assumed (motivated by the target of midazolam: GABA receptor). After implementation of *in vitro* binding affinity to GABRG2 (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Type A Receptor Subunit Gamma 2) (see [Section 2.2.1](#2.2.1-In-vitro-and-physico-chemical-data)), the  `Reference concentration` of GABRG2 (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Type A Receptor Subunit Gamma 2) was optimized to match best clinical data (see also [Section 2.3.4](#2.3.4-Automated-Parameter-Identification)). Note that the respective `koff` value was assumed to be 1 min<sup>-1</sup>.

### 2.3.3 Metabolism and Elimination

Two metabolic pathways were implement into the model via Michaelis-Menten kinetics 

* CYP3A4
* UGT1A4

Additionally, a renal clearance (assumed to be mainly driven by glomerular filtration) was implemented.

The first model simulations showed that gut wall metabolization was underrepresented in the PBPK model. In order to increase gut wall metabolization, the “mucosa permeability on basolateral side” (jointly the model parameters in the muscosa: ``P (interstitial->intracellular)`` and ``P (intracellular->interstitial)``) was estimated. A decrease in this permeability may lead to higher gut wall concentrations and, in turn, to a higher gut wall elimination. This parameter was preferred over other parameters such as relative CYP3A4 expression or fraction unbound (fu) in the gut wall as it is technically not limited to a maximum value of 100%.
