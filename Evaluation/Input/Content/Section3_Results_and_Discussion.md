The PBPK model for midazolam was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was built and evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* intravenous (bolus and infusions) and oral administrations (solution and tablets).
* a dose range of 0.001 to 40 mg.

The model quantifies metabolism via CYP3A4 and UGT1A4.

The next sections show:

1. the final model input parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-Final-Input-Parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-Diagnostics-Plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-Concentration-Time-Profiles).
