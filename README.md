This midazolam model is intended to be used as victim drug in CYP3A4-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDI).

This whole-body PBPK model of midazolam has been  developed using in particular published pharmacokinetic clinical data by Hohmann et al. 2015 [[1](#references)], Hyland et al. 2009 [[2](#references)] and Thummel et al. 1996 [[3](#references)]. 
The model has then been evaluated simulating a large number of clinical studies and comparing with respective observed data. 

The presented model represents an update of the midazolam model presented by Hanke et al. [[4](#references)].
Additional features in this update are:

- direct UGT1A4 metabolism,
- a decrease in the permeability between the intracellular and interstitial space  (parameters "P (intracellular->interstitial)" and "P (interstitial->intracellular)") in intestinal mucosa to optimize quantitatively the extent of gut wall metabolism,
- and binding to a hypothetical binding partner in the brain to optimize a late redistribution phase in midazolam plasma concentrations.
