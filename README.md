This repository contains:

- a [PK-Sim snapshot (*.json) file](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/working-with-pk-sim/pk-sim-documentation/importing-exporting-project-data-models#exporting-project-to-snapshot-loading-project-from-snapshot) of the current PBPK model
- static content (e.g. text blocks, *.md files) as inputs for an evaluation plan
- an evaluation plan (evaluation-plan.json) to create an evaluation report using the snapshot and static text blocks to display the performance of the model

**The latest release of the snapshot of the model, the evaluation plan and the static content can be found [here](../../releases/latest).**

**The latest release of the PK-Sim project model file and the respective evaluation report can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-PBPK-Model-Library/releases/latest).**



This midazolam model is intended to be used as victim drug in CYP3A4-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDI).

This whole-body PBPK model of midazolam has been  developed using in particular published pharmacokinetic clinical data by Hohmann et al. 2015 [[1](#references)], Hyland et al. 2009 [[2](#references)] and Thummel et al. 1996 [[3](#references)]. 
The model has then been evaluated simulating a large number of clinical studies and comparing with respective observed data. 

The presented model represents an update of the midazolam model presented by Hanke et al. [[4](#references)].
Additional features in this update are:

- direct UGT1A4 metabolism,
- a decrease in the permeability between the intracellular and interstitial space  (parameters "P (intracellular->interstitial)" and "P (interstitial->intracellular)") in intestinal mucosa to optimize quantitatively the extent of gut wall metabolism,
- and binding to a hypothetical binding partner in the brain to optimize a late redistribution phase in midazolam plasma concentrations.
